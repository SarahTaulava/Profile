      I am passionate about global development issues which led me to first work in Tonga in 2014, where I met my now husband. One of my most interesting experiences was helping to manage a 16 acre, off-grid resort island in the Kingdom of Tonga for 4 months while my husband cared for our then 11-month-old daughter. I now live on a working vineyard in the Coal River Valley, Tasmania with my 2-year-old daughter and 1 year-old son and enjoy foraging for sloe berries in late summer to make sloe gin.</p>
