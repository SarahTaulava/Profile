      I am passionate about global development issues which led me to first work in Tonga in 2014, where I met my now husband.  I now live on a working vineyard in the Coal River Valley, Tasmania with my 2-year-old daughter and 1 year-old son and enjoy foraging for sloe berries in late summer to make sloe gin.

        <h2>My interest in IT and when it started</h2>

        <p>My curiosity has taken me in many directions throughout my career, following opportunities as they came up rather than choosing a clear path forward. I honestly find nearly everything interesting and can get satisfaction out of every job – even a well-crafted filing system can be a source of joy! However, one thing that kept popping up in all my jobs were issues where I knew a better understanding of IT could help and I was frustrated by not understanding enough to fix these issues. I was always curious about how computers/networking worked but particularly working as an Australian Volunteer for International Development for Tonga Customs (2014-2017), I saw how inadequate their network was and how they primarily lacked expertise to improve things. I see IT as such a powerful tool to improve the world, if used appropriately, particularly in the development space. </p>
</article>
<article>
        <h2> The particular event or person that sparked my interest</h2>
        <p>I think what really got me thinking about the possibilities of IT was meeting a new friend in 2007 at the International Conference for RESULTS, basically a citizen lobby group on issues of poverty of which I ran the Hobart group for several years. He was developing a ‘Talking Book’ at the time which has now been rolled out in many of the poorest communities and the organisation has become Amplio. Using a simple, portable audio device the local farmers may get the latest agricultural information or those helping women birth their children can have the latest in child and maternal health advice recorded in their local language and accessible without literary, for example. That kind of thing is what really excited me about IT, what it can do for people. In the following years learning about the IT solutions for microfinance and remittances further sparked my interest in the link between development and IT. I see a lot of e-waste in Australia that would potentially improve networks in the Pacific and hope to explore the possibilities of development partner countries/states where e-waste from say, the Department of Agriculture, could be refurbished by volunteers and donated to a lesser developed Department of Agriculture in our region. I am sure waste servers etc here in Australia would be a marked improvement on some of those used in the Pacific.</p>

        <h2> Why I chose RMIT</h2>
        <p>Regardless of my career direction, I had reached a limit of how far I could progress without a degree – I knew I wanted to get a bachelor’s degree, but which one? While having time off to have my son, I found the opportunity to explore my interest in IT through the Women in ICT pilot program of TasTafe and the ACS and thought it was a good opportunity to test if I really would like IT to be a bigger part of my work life. I really enjoyed my Certificate III and the understanding I was developing and wanted to learn more. I needed to return to work financially, so was looking for a study option that fitted with full-time work. That led me to Open Universities Australia and RMIT. I hope to be able to fit my Bachelor of Information Technology around 2 young children and work in the sector which I begin in January. </p>

        <h2>What I expect to learn</h2>
        <p>I hope to learn how to create in IT, to be able to have an idea and know the steps to tangibly move toward it. This course already seems to be helping on that front! I also hope to learn how to advise my ex-colleagues in Tonga on IT issues and potentially do some consultancy work in the future in Tonga to improve, especially public sector, networks/IT in Tonga.  I expect to graduate with an understanding of networking, web design, programming, and software/application creation.</P>

  <h1>My ideal job</h1>
<section>
</div>
<div id="sectionContent">
          <a href="jobAd.PDF">Job Advertisement PDF</a>
        <h2>What attracts me</h2>
        <p>There is more than just the role itself that attracts me to a job like this one. As a mother to two young children looking to potentially spend extended periods in Tonga, the flexibility and fully remote conditions are part of the appeal.
        <p>Even the best local jobs in Tonga attract wages well below what is affordable to service even the smallest Australian mortgage. To be able to spend 6-12 months in Tonga for my children to experience their Tongan culture while keeping a foothold in Australia, I would need to be earning Australian-equivalent wages. Fitting work hours around being the best parent I can is an important consideration too. Practical realities of what my family needs from me and what I can realistically dedicate to a job at this point in my life is paramount.</p>
        <p>While, ultimately, I’d love to work in a programming/web design space I feel really passionate about – for the likes of an Amplio – the skills I would need could be met by leaning how to develop apps and products generally and that is not to say that some of the projects I would have the opportunity to undertake for consultancy businesses like CleverTech wouldn’t fit this brief. I could see developing the skills in a conventional job and volunteering my time for passion projects which may eventually lead to paid work in the global development space. </p>
        <h2>Skills, qualifications, and experience needed</h2>
        <p>For this role the applicant needs significant software development experience with over 3 years specifically working with mobile apps in some way. Some of this time/experience would need to be using the Ionic mobile app framework which is a hybrid, open-source software development kit (SDK) for JavaScript. Clearly, proficiency in JavaScript is important but experience across other iOS and Android mobile apps would also add value to the skill set. Strong written and verbal communication skills in English are required as is the ability to clearly communicate technical concepts. </p>
        <h2>Skills, qualifications and experience I bring</h2>
        <p>I have always had strong written and verbal communication skills only improved throughout 18 years working in roles where these skills were used daily with a variety of stakeholders. I have also had the opportunity to need to communicate more technical information to those with English as a second language which really helped to simplify my communication style and avoid jargon where possible. I can tailor my communication style to suit the audience, whether my colleagues with intimate technical knowledge or the customer who might not be familiar with the technical side of the project.</p>
        <p>I have a genuine interest in constantly learning and think I already behave in a way consistent with CleverTech’s culture; being respectful, collaborative and introspective by nature.</p>
        Having identified organisational skills as a naturally weaker area in my life generally but confirmed by my Personal Profile, I would need to implement strategies to monitor my own progress against tasks since this is a remote role with ‘no timesheets’. However, working towards a shared goal as part of a team is well suited to me and I can see value in most any project to find the work fulfilling.
        <h2>My plan to move towards my dream job</h2>
        <p>Through the Bachelor of Information Technology with a minor in Internet Design I hope to become proficient in basics of web/app design to be able to seek an entry-level job in this space where I can begin to build the several years of professional software development experience.</p>
        <p>Once I feel I feel more confident in my abilities, there are a handful of inspiring software/app/web companies operating out of Hobart (Ionata Digital, ISW and Savage Interactive) which hope to approach for an internship opportunity to start gaining professional experience earlier and continue to develop a portfolio. I am also in contact with another app start-up in development out of Hobart who are keeping me in mind for opportunities. </p>
        <p>Additionally, I plan to volunteer my skills for businesses I have a relationship with such as my employer and the owner of the vineyard where I live to help improve their web presence and mobile functionality using JavaScript and Ionic Framework. The vineyard owner is also interested in developing technology for vineyard management which I could hope to contribute to in future like an automated/remote frost-protection system with associated mobile application. </p>
        <p>Through the skills developed in this degree, with the practical foot-hold gained through demonstrating these skills in the ‘real world’ in an internship and then hopefully paid work in the space, I would be well on the path to meet the requirements of this role in the next 5-10 years. </p>

        <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<div id="sectionContent">
        <h2>What these tests mean to me</h2>
        <p>While, as expected, these test profile does not completely capture the variety in my personality they certainly point to some strengths and weaknesses that I strongly agree with. Many of these traits may be my natural inclination but I have sought out strategies to fight my natural tendencies where experience has taught me that the situation calls for it.. There is also significant flexibility in the results as they are not absolutes – being 61% introverted allows for 39% extroverted qualities, for example.</p>
        <p>The 16 Personalities (Welcome! | 16Personalities, 2020) result as an INFP-T I consider, overall, quite accurate when it comes to my motivations and inner-voice. I have been called a ‘diplomat/mediator’ more than once in my career because I am skilled at resolving and avoiding conflict. This trait is also evident in the Big 5 Personality test (Open-Source Psychometrics Project, 2019) with an agreeableness score of 95% and my struggle with organisation in the low conscientiousness score.  I do think I have a heightened sense of empathy as one of my strongest qualities and value kindness above most traits in others. I certainly acknowledge a tendency to overthink and over-plan before getting the actual project underway, traits which are also seen in my dominant learning styles (reflector/theorist). (Learning Styles Quiz, 2020) While it is something I have actively sought to improve, I struggle with being disorganised/last-minute and maintaining the tidy, structured life I aim for. For some time, I have been exploring tools such as David Allen’s Getting things Done method to overcome this.</p>
        <p>  These tests seem to point to natural tendencies not necessarily how I might seem to others. For example, while I do need time alone to recharge and find social engagements taxing, I appear quite social to others. Since I am often genuinely interested in other people’s stories, I tend not to struggle to have conversations with strangers. I do struggle to take criticism well if it is not what I was expecting to hear. True to character, though, with a tendency for severe self-criticism and drive for continual improvement, I have already usually identified the problem and have thought of a way to improve before it is mentioned by others and I am much more critical than they tend to be. Certainly, it is an effort for me not to ruminate on criticism privately for decades, but I am getting better at acknowledging the irrationality of it.</p>
        <p>What I see as not so accurate for me is that I do not always avoid conflict, quite enjoying a debate with topics and people I am comfortable with. To be fair, though, I am often easily convinced that others have better ideas or happy to progress with their ideas as I just might not feel my ideas are worth the conflict.
        </p>

        <h2>How these results might affect my behaviour in a team</h2>
        <p>I think I will be useful at helping everyone see different perspectives and get along, to find that middle ground with conflicting ideas. I will enjoy getting to know each team member and making them feel valued and their ideas welcomed. I expect one of the other team project ideas to be selected as I would not be committed to promoting my own.</p>
        <p>Having acknowledged my weaknesses in the past with regard to my natural lack of organisation, I also bring some useful ideas from productivity tools I have explored as a way of addressing this. To keep the conversations on track, I intend to finish meetings with ‘what is the very next action’ for each task and keeping ‘what are we trying to achieve’ as the backbone of our conversations (Allen, 2018). I will need to be particularly mindful of completing my tasks in a timely manner and planning in detail with my team to ensure I am staying organised with the group mzxaaterials. True to type, I have found in the past that having the pressure of letting others down allows me to focus on completing tasks to deadline better than with my independent work. It will be my other subject which I will need to be careful with as will tend to want to only prioritise my group projects.</p>
        <p>I will need to be conscious to not take constructive criticism personally and to be prepared to receive it in ways that might not be as thoughtfully structured as I would deliver it, since my personality would consider the delivery and the other person’s feelings more thoroughly than most.</p>
        <h2>How I should take these things into account when forming a team</h2>
        <p>It would be ideal to have a mix of personality types in a team; where some have weaknesses, others have strength. To balance my own tendencies, at least one other team member should have strong organisational skills with more of a tendency to jump in and get things done rather than focus on strategic planning.  I would like to learn from someone with these tendencies to see a new way to approach an assignment and I could temper their tendency to not plan things enough. But, regardless of the different personalities, open and honest communication about strengths and weaknesses will be the most important exercise. Any potential issues with mixes of traits can be identified and strategised by the group and tasks allocated based on particular strengths and additional support provided where weaknesses might exist. An example might be to share my actual progress prior to the twice weekly meetings (not just report on it), thereby changing the ultimate deadlines to manageable mini-deadlines. My last-minute rush will happen prior to the weekly meetings rather than the actual deadlines. This sharing would likely not be necessary for many other personality types who would be able to just report on any issues they might be facing.</p>

      <div class="sectionTitle">   
        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
</div>
<div id="sectionContent">
        <h>Overview</h2>


        <p>‘Maker’ will help people become the best Country Women’s Association (CWA) version of themselves in no time. Alerting subscribers to locally available forgeable items that may be in season linked with the DIY instructions to turn them into products at home in any Etsy shop. Based on location, the subscriber will receive alerts of what may be in season in the public spaces around them or that people are willing to share from their local community. The innovation is taking a foraging app beyond edibles to include crafting projects and to link the foraged items to the instructions on how the subscriber might use it.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>While there has been a general revival of the Arts and Crafts movement over the last few years with the likes of Etsy, stuck within a small radius of our homes this year, many have taken the next step to exploring the handmade with their own two hands and from (very) locally available items.</p>

        <p>With social calendars emptied, there has been time to slow down, properly explore their local environment and try some of those old-school activities like starting sourdough or crochet.  Finding a few sloe hedges along the train tracks near my home, I personally explored harvesting and creating my own sloe gin which, conveniently, has just become JobKeeper-friendly low-cost Christmas gifts. I have also seen the large number of wine-grape cuttings that are created during pruning which many people would love to plant in their own gardens, if only those interested were in touch with those who had an excess.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Maker will be an application available across iOS, Android and web devices, developed using the hybrid Ionic Framework due to its ability to access native features easily using plugins and its record of fast and reliable performance (Appstronaut, 2020).</p>

        <p>Geolocation will be used to provide the user’s physical location to determine local seasonality and potential finds in their area (using a Google Maps API). There will be an opportunity to mark locations where items were found as well as share locations to a public map to alert users where public supplies might be found.</p>

        <p>There is integration with calendar features so that seasonality can be tracked, and alerts pushed at time when certain plants flower or fruit or push particular gift ideas in line with seasonal holidays, for example.</p>

        <p>There will be a database of forgeable items which can be searched with basic details of each item and how to harvest and links to ways to use them like recipes or craft project instructions. Ideas will also be searchable, categorised into different types of gift ideas, resulting product type categories and difficultly level. Finding sources for this database information will be a large part of development, the intention is to partner with several bloggers in a local area to contribute project ideas and local knowledge with links and acknowledgement of their materials or even partnerships built with them to produce content for the longer term as a part of the founding team.</p>

        <p>Users will have the opportunity to rate recipes/instructions, provide photos of their own versions and suggest ideas not already provided using those foraged items which may be flagged to be formatted as official project ideas. Each project idea will be available in printable, uniformly formatted PDF. Each database entry will have details of geographical location where it can be found and has been found and seasonality date range. Special content can be pushed as suitable such as ‘Valentine’s day gift ideas’ or special interest guest contributors such as indigenous foods/medicine/craft in honour of NAIDOC week or child-friendly project timed for promotion when school holidays begin.</p>

        <p>There will be a forum for communication between users about project ideas and a separate thread or formalised marketplace for private offerings of raw items to be used in exchange for other products or return value-added products (ie, if someone offers surplus lemons, the receiver may receive a jar of lemon curd in return).</p>

        <h3>Stage 1</h3>
        <p>The first stage of development will be centred around finding contributors from relevant content identified online to start to build the database with associated search terms using MySQL. Without the actual content, this project is not viable.

        <p>The minimum viable product to be developed in this stage will be a basic functioning application with around 50 projects and forgeable item details which are searchable. There is no limit to what projects/items can be included but the goal would be to begin to test the functionality with a minimally viable product and continue to refine the user experience from there.</p>

        <p> Stage 1 application design will focus on building the wire-framed features for iOS, Android and Web through the Ionic Framework (one source code for the 3 platforms) with an a backend MySQL database. User registration, geolocation, calendar and searching functionality will be the Stage 1 coding achievements.</p>

        <h3>Stage 2</h3>

        <p>This stage will focus on building content further and improving the user experience bringing in design expertise to improve the look and feel of the applications.</p>

        <h3>Stage 3</h3>

        <p>Here the forum features will be added, and a potentially formalised marketplace will be explored. User lead content and map pins for forage locations as well as star ratings for project ideas will also be added in this stage.</p>


        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

        <p>The app itself will be developed via Ionic React which is open-source and the embedded database developed through a MySQL hosted server, initially a shared server service through a business like Bluehost. While significant for the application, the size of the database is initially quite small for this project, so an entry-level hosting service would likely be sufficient.</p>

        <p>Ionic React was selected for its accessibility using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and UI components, ability to include native features though plugins and cost effectiveness as a hybrid development platform. (Build Native and Progressive Web Apps with React and Ionic, 2020) MySQL was chosen because if its proven performance and popularity in the app space and scalability for future growth, a shared, hosted server to start with as a lower cost approach suitable for a small start-up.</p>


        <h2>Skills Required</h2>

        <p>The skills to identify materials for foraging and design projects with those materials are certainly available with many homestead/craft/cooking bloggers producing appropriate content daily, getting several on the team to shape the app and provide content for the database is the ideal solution here.</p>

        <p>Strong HTML/CSS or JavaScript knowledge is required to develop the app and website using Ionic Framework though using Ionic React components will minimise the skill level required for an impressive user experience. HTML/CSS and JavaScript are relatively common skills within the IT community but good application development is time consuming and, therefore, expensive. Putting the time into free tutorials and formal study in these areas to be able to at least wire-frame a prototype without having to pay an hourly rate would be advisable, seeking expert input as required or in an advisory capacity while still determining if it is a viable product.</p>

        <p>Design consultation will be needed through Stage 2 of the project to really find the style and look for Maker.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>If successful, there will be a valuable resource to help people feel capable of making things again, feel the joy of creating something tangible, taking the time to explore their environment, reduce waste and increase community connection. It will be a place for fostering new ideas and re-learning traditional ones, to learn from each other and share what nature offers. There will be enough subscribers to fund the content and ideally make a profit which will benefit the application as well, the more users, the better the experience will become for all.</p>
